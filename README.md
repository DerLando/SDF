# SDF-rs

Implementation of **S**igned **D**istance **F**ields data structures and algorithms.

The main things this library will achieve *in the future* are:
 - Generate a `SDF`
 - Manipulate or combine multiple `SDF`
 - Generate basic triangle meshes from a given `SDF`

We want to implement multiple API surfaces:
 - Use as a rust library
 - FFI via function calls
 - Fluent `SDF` creation via an interpreted functional-style language
